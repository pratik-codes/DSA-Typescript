# Linked List

Linked list if often called as node based data structure. These are nodes which hold a value, and next and previous values of the connected node. Something like this

`a <-> b <-> d <-> e`

Inside this linked list we can say b has three metadata

1. value
2. next (next node reference)
3. prev (previous node reference)

When you store values in linked list no memory is wasted unlike arrays. Hence you can say linked list are efficient way of storing the data.
